===Etymology 1===
Circa 1935 as nonsense word, circa 1960 in programming sense.
{{rel-top|detailed etymology}}
[[File:Chinese Good Fortune Cross Stitch Pattern.JPG|thumb|upright|'''foo''' is presumably based on the {{w|fu character}} (fú, 福)]]
[[File:Fuxingqi.JPG|thumb|A ''Fú'' figurine of the [[w:Fu Lu Shou|Chinese star god]]]]
Originated circa 1935 as nonsense word in ''{{w|Smokey Stover}}'' comic strip (1935–73) by {{w|Bill Holman}} (from which also {{term|foo fighter|lang=en}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;jargon&quot;&gt;“[http://catb.org/jargon/html/F/foo.html foo]”, ''[http://catb.org/jargon/html/index.html The Jargon File]''
&lt;/ref&gt; Holman states that his usage was from seeing “foo” on the base of a jade Chinese figurine in [[w:Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown, San Francisco]], meaning “good luck”, presumably a transliteration of the {{w|fu character}} {{term|福||fortune, happiness, prosperity|tr=fú|lang=cmn}},
&lt;ref name=&quot;jargon&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.smokey-stover.com/history.html The History of Bill Holman]&quot;, [http://www.smokey-stover.com/ Smokey-Stover.com], Smokey Stover LLC – article by nephew of Bill Holman&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://members.aol.com/EOCostello/ Warner Brothers Cartoon Companion]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and figurines of the trio of eponymous male &quot;star gods&quot; [[w:Fu Lu Shou|''Fú, Lù, Shòu'']] are common in Chinese communities. Meaning influenced by {{term|fooey|lang=en}}, {{term|fool|lang=en}}, and {{term|feh|lang=en}}. Used throughout the comic strip’s run, with later uses in the 1930s include ''{{w|The Daffy Doc}}'' (1938) and ''[[w:Pogo (comic strip)|Pogo]].''

In computing usage, popularized by the {{w|Tech Model Railroad Club}} (TMRC), whose 1959 ''Dictionary of the TMRC Language'', had an entry similar to the following, parodying the mantra {{w|Om mani padme hum}} (replacing {{term|om|lang=en}} with '''foo'''):&lt;ref name=&quot;jargon&quot; /&gt;
: FOO: The first syllable of the sacred chant phrase “FOO MANE PADME HUM.” Our first obligation is to keep the foo counters turning.
Related also to {{term|foobar|lang=en}}, which is presumably derived from '''foo''' rather than the reverse.&lt;ref name=&quot;jargon&quot; /&gt;
